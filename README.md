# SOOD - Front license plate holder for Tesla Model 3.

##### No one wants to drill holes on the front bumper to fix their license plate, or stick the license plate holder to it. There are ways around this to fix the license plate holder to grill below but many of them block airflow to vents behind them. The only option is to lift the license plate up and not touch the front bumper to keep it its good shape. I hope this does that.

- 3D Print a pair of V1* (or) 3D print one V2. 
- You should choose the appropriate material that suits fit for your use and taste. (I selected White Color, and used PLA for V1, ABS for V2.)
- This is for Tesla Model 3 2017-2018 (currently), 
- Gives a sufficient lift to name plate by preventing airflow to vents behind the front bumper.
- Print on any color to match your cars color.
- V1 will need a  should allow aerodynamic flow of air around the lift handles, but not sure if this is a huge factor.

-- I dont have a printer at home, so i used service provided on https://www.3dhubs.com and paid not more than $30 per print. You can choose any 3D Printing service provider, and generate these models. (Definetly a good price 
-- you may have to drill holes by youself/
