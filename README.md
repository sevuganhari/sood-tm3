# SOOD Tesla Model 3 - Front name plate holder
### Features

- DIY
- 3D Print a pair of V1* (or) 3D print one V2. 
- You should choose the appropriate material that suits fit for your use and taste. (I selected White Color, and used PLA for V1, ABS for V2.)
- This is for Tesla Model 3 2017-2018 (currently), 
- Gives a sufficient lift to name plate by preventing airflow to vents behind the front bumper.
- Print on any color to match your cars color.
- V1 will need a  should allow aerodynamic flow of air around the lift handles, but not sure if this is a huge factor.

-- I dont have a printer at home, so i used service provided on https://www.3dhubs.com and paid not more than $30 per print. You can choose any 3D Printing service provider, and generate these models. (Definetly a good price 
-- you may have to drill holes by youself/
