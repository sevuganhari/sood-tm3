# SOOD - Front license plate holder for Tesla Model 3.

##### This bumper license plate holder is designed as one possible option to mount license plate on Tesla Model 3.

### **_This component is engineered to connect to the front grill of Tesla Model 3. So be mindful of structural stability of the grill and your best judgement before deciding to print any of these 3D Models to be printed for your own use on a Tesla Model 3(2017/2018). This is an open source model, so feel free to experiment with this model and enhance it as needed for your use._**

###### **_You can fork this and make better models. If you want to merge your changes, feel free to initiate pull request._**

- For printing this in 3D you can choose the appropriate material that suits fit for your use and taste. 
- This is for Tesla Model 3 2017-2018 only 
- Its designed to gives a sufficient lift to name plate and allows some airflow to vent behind the front bumper without being blocked by the license plate.
- Print on any color to match your cars color.

### V3
- This is an enhancement on V2
- Holes are provided to avoid drilling. Designed to use 3mm dia screw.

### V2
- Should provide good strength due to its design.
- Each handle ends in a wider base that would prevent wobble even without nameplate. (unlike V1)

### V1
- V1 will allow free air flow around the lift handles, but not sure if this is a huge factor yet.
- Though V1 looks good, support structures for 3D print may have to be provided to get a proper finish.
- Relies on nameplate mounting to prevent wobble from side to side.

### Material Choice & Printing
- I would recommend V2 printed with ABS as a best solution for this.
- I did not have a printer at home, so I used service provided on https://www.3dhubs.com and paid not more than $30 per print. You can choose any 3D Printing service provider, and generate these models. (Definitely a good price 
- You may have to drill holes by yourself and find the right screw to fix holder & license plate to it. 
- Will provide links to purchase of screw / nuts / bolts etc. in the near future.

#### WARNING - NOT A PERFECT FIT for Practical use.
#### Print an additional 60mm x 10mm x 10mm spacer as a layer to prevent contact with front bumper.
